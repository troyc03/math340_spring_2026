    "\n",
    "The **bisection method** is a numerical method of solving $f(x) = 0$ where $f$ is a real-valued, continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$. It is obtained from the **Intermediate Value Theorem**, which says that a number $p$ exists in $[a,b]$ such that $f(p) = 0$. The method works by iteratively halving subintervals of $[a,b]$ and, at each step, locating the half containing $p$.\n",

    "Suppose $a_1 = a$, $b_1 = b$, and let $p_1$ be the midpoint of $[a,b]$. \n",

    "The bisection method exhibits linear convergence with a convergence rate of:\n",

    "1. **Guaranteed convergence** for continuous functions that change sign over the interval\n",
    "2. **Predictable performance** - the number of iterations needed can be calculated in advance\n",
    "3. **Robustness** - works reliably even for functions with discontinuous derivatives\n",

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relatively slow convergence** compared to methods like Newton-Raphson\n",
    "2. **Requires bracketing** - must start with an interval where the function changes sign\n",

    "### Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing the bisection method, it's important to:\n",
    "- Verify that the function changes sign over the initial interval\n",

    "# Root Finding Methods: Newton's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's Method (also known as the Newton-Raphson method) is an iterative technique used to find the roots of a differentiable function. It's a powerful numerical method that converges quadratically when the initial guess is close enough to the root.\n",
